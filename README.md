🧠 How It Works – Step by Step

1. User enters the city name in the input box.


2. JavaScript captures the input and sends a request to OpenWeatherMap API.


3. The API returns JSON weather data for that city.


4. The app dynamically updates the UI to show:

Temperature in °C/°F

Humidity percentage

Wind speed in km/h

Weather status (e.g., Rainy, Cloudy, Sunny)
